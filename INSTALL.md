Installing RelaXXPplayer
========================

## 1. Required tools and programs

* Linux or BSD-Server
* A Web server
* PHP (PHP 8 recommended)
* MPD

## 2. Configure MPD

If you install MPD with a package-manager, you only have to point the entry "music_directory" to the directory where your songs (MP3, WAV) are stored. 
		
		sudo vim /etc/mpd.conf

After rebuilding the database 
		
		sudo mpd --create-db 

and restarting the daemon, 
		
		sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart

you should be ready to play music with MPD. For further information's read "man mpd.conf".

!!! The volume-slider will only work with mixer="software" enabled !!!

## 3: Install RelaxxPlayer

Just unpack the relaxx-archive into your Web-Root. Make sure, that the /config directory is writable by PHP. If necessary, change user-rights or owner.

The subfolder ./music/ (via `ln -s` or bind mounts) should point to the root directory of your mpd-music collection (usually /var/lib/mpd/music). That directory must be readable by the webserver in order to play music in a browser through flash-applet.

========================

Once you have opened the "config"-dialog you have basic access to the MPD connection values and RelaXXPlayer-settings.

* If the MPD-Daemon is running at the same computer the **HOST** is 127.0.0.1 or localhost
* The default **PORT** defined in /etc/mpd.conf for MPD is 6600
